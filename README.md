# Outbound Open Source - Guide

## What is this repo about? - TL;DR

Contributing to or starting own open source projects (also called *outbound open source*) can support your open source strategy. If you did only consume open source software so far, outbound open source can be the next step of your open source journey.

This guide contains comprehensive information about how to start contributions to open source projects. It mentions the most important topics that you should take care of and describes different contributions models and procedures, that can be implemented in companies of any size. Finally, you learn how spare-time contributions can be handled.

Starting open source projects is another part of the guide. It describes the typical lifecycle of such projects and explains why starting such projects can make sense for your company. Legal aspects such as IP and licensing are covered, as well as administrative and technical topics such as repository management and recommendable tools. Finally, the guide goes into project promotion, community management and touches on project analytics and open source metrics.
